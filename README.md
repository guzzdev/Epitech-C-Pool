# Epitech C Pool üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This repository gathers all my C projects from the legendary Epitech C Piscine.  
Each folder represents a specific day or project from the intense training period, including basic algorithms, memory handling, string manipulation, and even games.

> üìÅ All projects are preserved with full Git history thanks to this `merge-repos.sh` script.
